# Hi, I'm Catrina 👋

**Business Intelligence Professional | Analytics Engineer | Data Storyteller**

I turn messy data into clear decisions. With experience spanning enterprise data warehouses, ETL pipelines, and executive dashboards, I specialize in building analytics infrastructure that actually gets used.

## What I Do

I work at the intersection of data engineering and business strategy—building the systems that help companies understand what's happening and why. My sweet spot is taking chaotic, undocumented data environments and transforming them into reliable, self-service analytics platforms.

**Recent highlight:** Identified an $11M revenue misattribution issue through data quality analysis, leading to corrected forecasting and reporting across the organization.
